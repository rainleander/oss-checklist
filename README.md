# The Importance of an Open Source Community
There are several reasons why people opt for open source vs proprietary these days. Open source encourages innovation through collaboration, allows for more efficient responses to security issues, reduces bias and discrimination and enables wider adoption and distribution.

Through collaboration, contributors experience a lower risk of burnout because they are part of something bigger than the individual, contributors receive feedback more efficiently because users can engage directly with the project developers, and contributors have a competitive edge on the job market because they’re developing on the cutting edge.

Enterprises embrace open source because it allows them to start small and scale immediately, to build a proof of concept quickly to test if it will work for them, to avoid vendor lock-in, and to create the feature you want to see in the project.

The reason why open source can do all these things for so many people is because the power of community is at the core of successful projects. Without community, a project is only technically open source because of its license and won’t reap the benefits of rapid innovation, consistent release cycles, and faster response to current trends and market needs.

In order to create a healthy, rich community full of globally diverse contributors, we must make it easy for everyone to use the project, clearly explain how to contribute, build personal relationships, make people feel included, and create a safe environment by setting a code of conduct.
## Make it Easy for Everyone to Use the Project
This is not just about documentation or sample apps or workshops, but about every piece of content that enables users of all learning styles to become successful within the project. This touches documentation, yes, but also marketing and education and developer relations and anyone else who creates content that will influence, inspire, and encourage people on their developer journey from “I’ve heard of this project and I’m curious to learn more” to “I have contributed to this project’s core.”
-  Documentation details all aspects of the project
- Content includes examples and use cases - this may be from one line commands to extensive sample applications and customer implementations
- Content is updated regularly and is easy to contribute to
## Clearly Explain How to Contribute
Collaborators who want to contribute need to have all the information at hand to get started and work at full speed. This includes an up to date contribution file, well labeled issues using ‘good first issue’ or something similar indicating an issue for new contributors, and an informal or formal mentorship program or office hours or clearly indicated ways for people to ask questions.
## Build Personal Relationships
Collaborators are people, not computers, and people need connection in order to avoid burnout, maintain sound mental health, and work efficiently. To that end, every community needs a space to communicate, like IRC or discord, to be welcomed to the community, and to be recognized for their contributions.
## Make People Feel Included
The more people feel they belong to a project, the more enthusiastic and motivated they’ll be to stick with the project through thick and thin. What are the best ways to make the open source community feel included?
- Feedback of all kinds is heard - both positive and negative.
- Moderators and representatives are available to the community via several communication paths.
- Public recognition for contribution. Extra highlight for first time contribution. Possibly via an Author.md or Contributors.md list on github.
- A mentorship program, either formal or informal, to help people complete their first contribution.
- Promote trusted contributors to maintainers with commit access and a chance to maintain the project to a professional standard.
## Create a Safe Environment
An open source project brings people together from all over the world with different cultures, backgrounds, and variations in cognition. While diversity is key to innovation, it can also lead to major conflicts within the open source community.

[According to GitHub](https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/), negative interactions between users in open source are quite common. Nearly 18% of people who're active in open source communities have been faced with a negative interaction with another person. Moreover, 50% of them have been a witness to a negative communication between other people in open source. The most common negative interactions are impoliteness, name calling, and stereotyping. A whopping 21% of users said they stopped contributing to a project because of a negative interaction.

A project needs to offer a harassment-free experience for all users, regardless of their age, ethnicity, gender, nationality, sexual identity, or religion. In order to foster an open and welcoming environment and avoid negative interactions, post and enforce a Code of Conduct.
